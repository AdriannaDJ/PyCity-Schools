# PyCity Schools Analysis

I refered to lessons 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 on pandas and jupyter notebook throughout the analysis.

I utlized Xpert Learning Assistant to debug my high-level snapshot, helped to properly type list of dictionary for dataframe, and provided pandas function to update series to numerical.

I recieved assistance on the pd.cut with peers.
